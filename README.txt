#LehighChain
Hello! This is a simple Java blockchain for educational purposes. The printed interface of this blockchain relates to energy grid operations. Specifically, it relates to the dispatch and collection of electricity between grid operators and utilities. 


NOTE: This is not a fully functioning, ready-for-production blockchain. Instead, this is a proof of concept implementation to help you understand what a blockchain is (i.e. hashing, digital fingerprints, etc.)
